# Vault
### About
Vault is a simple file storage system created in ASP.Net Core. It aims to be simple and reliable as possible. 

### Example
Here's a little video showing how some things look and feel:

### Technology and features
It utilizes Entity Framework, and SQLite; but can be quickly adjusted to any database. It is mainly designed to be ran on Windows machines but since it is .Net Core it can be modified to work on other platforms.

Currently there is support for true on the fly zipping, image viewer/image processing, basic file system (renaming, deleting, etc).

### Intent
I'm (vldr) planning on developing it until I feel that it is finished. I initially planned this to be a simple hobby project so keep that in mind...



### Contribute
I would love to have anybody contribute to this little project. I'm open to anything suggestions, pull requests, etc.
